Take-home project for the front-end position at Hive.

This project uses Vite as its build tool for React. Vite is not a library-- all components are made from scratch using HTML/CSS/ReactJS. More details on Vite here: https://vite.dev/guide/

To run the test page with our dropdown components, open a terminal and nav to the project directory. Then run:
npm install
npm run dev
